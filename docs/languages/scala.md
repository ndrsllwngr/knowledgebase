## About
> Scala (/ˈskɑːlɑː/ SKAH-lah) is a general-purpose programming language providing support for both object-oriented programming and functional programming. The language has a strong static type system. Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions are aimed to address criticisms of Java.
